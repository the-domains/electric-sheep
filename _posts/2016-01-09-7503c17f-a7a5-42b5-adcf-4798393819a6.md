The human brain is one of the most interesting places we know of in the 
universe. Imagine, if you will, an observer from outside of our 
universe. Somehow they have found a way to bridge the gap and can make a
very limited observation from anywhere within our universe. Almost 
anywhere they choose, whether within a star, in the depths of space, or 
on some remote planet would either be so chaotic that their small 
observation would tell them little about anywhere else, or so inert that
there is very little information to be observed. Of all the places we 
know of, a small observation of the human brain would yield the 
most information about the universe at large.
